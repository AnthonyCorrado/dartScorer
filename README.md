# dartScorer

A quick and dirty weekend project developed to track scores of 301, 501, tourney style and non tourney style. A touch dartboard interface allows for easy and accurate scoring.

Custom game engine handles proper rules of scoring depending on game selection.

Future additions will include stat-tracking, cricket game option, and a practice mode to help improve your dartsmenship.

Quick confession...the player DB has been hardcoded for the time being. AGGHHH!!!!
